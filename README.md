1. Equitable and Chriſtian Conſiderations and Reſolutions of divers worthy and Well-minded Inhabitants of Middleſex, publiſhed in Print (rather then communicated in written hand, that they may be more ſpeedily divulged and more readily uſed) by a true Z•lot of the welfare, as of all the Counties of England in generall, ſo eſpecially of that County in particular: For aſſiſtance and ſuccour to the Religious and well-aff•cted Miniſters and people there reſiding, againſt the injurious and licentious violation of their perſons, liberties and eſtates; By Popiſh, prophane, and other malicious and miſchievous diſturbers of the publike Peace, threatning thereby (as by the like Tyrannie and ſpoil in other places) the utter ruine of the Kingdom, if the true Patriots (in all parts) do not quickly and couragiouſly make head againſt them.
